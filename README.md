# Tic Tac Toe Game (Command line version)

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

I will be recreating the Tic-Tac-Toe game in commandline using the OOP concept I have learnt so far.
