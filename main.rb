# Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should 
# be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from

# have to.

# [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
# [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [1,4,7], [2,5,8], [3,6,9], [1,5,9], [7,5,3]]
# row = | 
# col = --+---+--

# 1. Display instuctions
