# Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should 
# be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from 
# wasting an hour of coding.

# Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you 
# have to.

# 3. Allow player's to choose cell position via 1-9
# 4. Update your data with the player name or symbol ('X', 'O')
# 5. Loop through the a solution collections to check if anyone has got a line
# 6. If both players didn't get a line then it's a draw
# 7. Ask if the player would like to play again 

# Possible methods - check win condition, update board, deal with player move data
